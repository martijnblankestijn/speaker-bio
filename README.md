# Speaker Bio

## Bio
Martijn started out as a business economist. 
Fortunately, after graduating, he recognised his mistake and took a swing at programming. 
These were the early days of EJB 1.0, CORBA and all those other sure silver bullets. 

However, instead of being discouraged, packing his stuff and never looking back, he decided to stick around and see if the future had something better in store. 
Today he thinks that something is Kotlin and Scala. Having been around so long, he learned a bit of nuance along the way.

He is a consultant for [JPoint](https://www.jpoint.nl/) with 20 years of experience in Java Development for different enterprises in the Netherlands.
